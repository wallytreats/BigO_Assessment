# Big O Assessment

 ### O Boy! It's time to evaluate your understanding of Big O Notation!

 ##

  PART ONE: Please answer the following questions:

 1. Describe the purpose of Big 0.

    > describes how much time an algorithm will take to run if it takes as long as possible. If you are searching for a number in an array, it assumes that the algorithm will find the number at the very end of the algorithm running.

---


 2. What 2 things does it measure?

    > time vs input
---


 3. Which of the following shows Big O time complexity in order?

    a) O(1), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    b) O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2)

    c) O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n), O(n^2)

    > the answer is B.

4. Which of these algorithm(s) run in O(log n) time?

   Binary Search

   Bubble Sort

   Quick Sort (average case)

   Linear Search

   > Binary Search
---



5. Select the best time complexity that even the most efficient sort algorithm can have.

    O(log n)

    O(n log n)

    O(n)

    O(n^2)

    > O(log n)
---


 6. Describe what sets these these 3 complexities apart from each other: O(1), O(n) and O(n^2)

    > O(n^2) runs for the length of the input, O(1) runs a set number of times no matter what, and O(n) runs as many times as it needs to then stops

---


7. How would you recognize O(log n) and O(n log n) time complexities in a function?

    > O(log n) usually splits the array and O(n log n) will run all the way through

    Upload your file to your repository when complete and submit in Learn --> Exercises.

    1. O(1)

    2. O(n)

    3. O(n^2)
